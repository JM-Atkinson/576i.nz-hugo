# 576i.nz-hugo

Welcome to 576i.nz. This is the home of my site since I migrated to using Hugo as my static site generator, in favour of Jekyll.

To work on this site, all you need is the contents of this repository, and Hugo.

To install Hugo:

openSUSE:
`sudo zypper install hugo`

macOS Homebrew:
`brew install hugo`

Or [https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/](many other ways to get Hugo).

Then clone the repo. This repo contains submodules, so your command would be:
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/JM-Atkinson/576i.nz-hugo.git`

In the root directory of the repo, run `hugo -D server` to do interactive development.
