I'm a tech hobbyist thick into the Unix world, retro technology, and open source free software. I'm a recent graduate of the University of Auckland, and currently work for one of New Zealand's largest telecommunications providers.

I also have keen interests in personal finance, economics, political philosophy, music, and cinema, so you may see content about these things from time to time (particularly the cinema part...).

## FAQs:

#### What is this site about?

This little site is essentially a wax lyrical about whatever my hobbyist or professional experiences bring me across that I can be bothered to write about. Expect content on Unix, technology history, product management, and occasionally some hardware restoration and other fun things.

#### WTF does 576i mean?

You can find out what 576i means [here](/576i).

#### Where can you find me?

I am reachable at <josh@576i.nz>, this is the best way to get in touchâ€”I actually read my emails!

If you use LinkedIn, I have one of [those](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-atkinson/) too.

Otherwise I have a [GitHub](https://github.com/JM-Atkinson), but I don't use it much.
