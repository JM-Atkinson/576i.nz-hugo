      <description>I write this on the 11th of July 2021, twelve days to the commencement of the 2020 Summer Olympics[^1], officially Games of the XXXII Olympiad (第32回オリンピック競技大会). These Olympics are poised to be symbolically important for the world, as they take place on the recovery path for the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had the world in it&amp;rsquo;s grips since early 2020. Of course, COVID-19 is the reason the 2020 Olympics are taking place in 2021.</description>

Directed by Jang Hoon and written by Eom Yu-na, the film contrary to its cheery poster depicts events in Gwangju, which took place over a week in May of 1980.</description>
