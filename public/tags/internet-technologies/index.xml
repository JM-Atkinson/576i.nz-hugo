      <description>Big thanks to binu.nz, matteas.nz, and pancake.nz for their help on this project.
Earlier this year I moved to a new note taking solution, Trilium Notes. After a lengthy discovery process including learning about the world of networked brain apps and Zettlekasten, I settled on Trilium for several reasons: it&amp;rsquo;s open source, self-hosted with a browser interface, has extensive markup functionality including the ability to export to Markdown (this article was written in Trilium), and is extensible via a note type called a ‘script note’.</description>

      <description>So if you’ve paid any attention to news about the internet in the last thirty years you’ve probably heard that we’re going to imminently run out of IPv4 addresses, like, any day now. Various groups have been saying this since the 90’s, with RFCs describing the problem and everything. So why aren’t single IPv4 addresses the world’s most expensive numbers? Why are us lowly consumers allowed the luxury of having our very own hyper-scarce IPv4 address just for our house!</description>
