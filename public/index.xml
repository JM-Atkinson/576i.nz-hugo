      <description>I write this on the 11th of July 2021, twelve days to the commencement of the 2020 Summer Olympics[^1], officially Games of the XXXII Olympiad (第32回オリンピック競技大会). These Olympics are poised to be symbolically important for the world, as they take place on the recovery path for the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had the world in it&amp;rsquo;s grips since early 2020. Of course, COVID-19 is the reason the 2020 Olympics are taking place in 2021.</description>

      <description>So if you’ve paid any attention to news about the internet in the last thirty years you’ve probably heard that we’re going to imminently run out of IPv4 addresses, like, any day now. Various groups have been saying this since the 90’s, with RFCs describing the problem and everything. So why aren’t single IPv4 addresses the world’s most expensive numbers? Why are us lowly consumers allowed the luxury of having our very own hyper-scarce IPv4 address just for our house!</description>

      <description>This article contains spoilers!
Amid recent popularity of South Korean cinema in the west, such as the hugely successful Parasite by Bong Joon-ho (which is definitely worth the watch), I wanted to highlight a film much less known in the west - A Taxi Driver / 택시운전사 (2017). Directed by Jang Hoon and written by Eom Yu-na, the film contrary to its cheery poster depicts events in Gwangju, which took place over a week in May of 1980.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a tech hobbyist thick into the Unix world, retro technology, and open source free software. I&amp;rsquo;m a recent graduate of the University of Auckland, and currently work for one of New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s largest telecommunications providers.
I also have keen interests in personal finance, economics, politics, music, and cinema, so you may see content about these things from time to time (particularly the cinema part&amp;hellip;).
What is this site about? This little site is essentially a wax lyrical about whatever my hobbyist or professional experiences bring me across that I can be bothered to write about.</description>

      <title>WTF is 576i and what does that mean?</title>
      <link>https://576i.nz/576i/</link>

      <description>576i is a display specification for regular format PAL television. It stands for 576 lines vertically, interlaced over 50 fields.
Let&amp;rsquo;s break that down. Before the days of progressive digital video like we have on all modern computers and digital television broadcasts, video for television was encoded using analog standards. There were/are three competing standards for this — NTSC (National Television System Committee), PAL (Phase Alternating Line), and SECAM. SECAM is essentially a slightly modified PAL, so there are two major standards at play here.</description>
