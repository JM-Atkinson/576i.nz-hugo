      <description>This article contains spoilers!
Amid recent popularity of South Korean cinema in the west, such as the hugely successful Parasite by Bong Joon-ho (which is definitely worth the watch), I wanted to highlight a film much less known in the west - A Taxi Driver / 택시운전사 (2017). Directed by Jang Hoon and written by Eom Yu-na, the film contrary to its cheery poster depicts events in Gwangju, which took place over a week in May of 1980.</description>

      <description>576i is a display specification for regular format PAL television. It stands for 576 lines vertically, interlaced over 50 fields.
Let&amp;rsquo;s break that down. Before the days of progressive digital video like we have on all modern computers and digital television broadcasts, video for television was encoded using analog standards. There were/are three competing standards for this — NTSC (National Television System Committee), PAL (Phase Alternating Line), and SECAM. SECAM is essentially a slightly modified PAL, so there are two major standards at play here.</description>
